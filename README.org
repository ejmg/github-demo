  This repo was created as a demonstration and introduction into Git and Github as version control tools. 
  This repository's "main program", ~demo.py~, is intended to be used as a driver that can be trivially edited and patched
  after being forked by a user.

  Under ~/presentation~ you will find the ~git-basics.org~ file and its exported and formatted PDF version. In either file,
  you will find an introduction to Git and Github and...

** You will learn how to:
   - start a repository of your own
   - add a remote
   - commit files
   - fork a repository (this one)
   - contribute an edit of a forked repository
   - make a pull request
   - and many of the definitions from above (and more)

* *Please feel free* to use this repository

  *as a way to get your feet wet with Git and Github  if you do not have experience with these tools.*

* TODO

- [ ] cover branching more
- [ ] cover merging more
- [ ] make the respective demo code for the above
